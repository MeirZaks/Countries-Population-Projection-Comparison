Welcome to this little project I did for a course!
It's simply a little site that allows you to compare different countries population projectories, two countries at a time.
The site will display the population of each by the year that one will overtake the other, according to the projectory.
The projectory is taken from the OECD Data Explorer API, and with additional calculations done for years beyond the projections the API provides.
Note that the projections beyond what the API provides are very much inaccurate and just for fun. I calculate it by the population growth of the last year the API provides for each country times the amount of years until one overpasses the other.

Feel free to compare, have fun and find bugs!
